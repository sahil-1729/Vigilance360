You’re probably seen the ridiculous videos on social media. There’s a celebrity—maybe it’s Sydney Sweeney or Tom Hanks—talking directly to the camera about some product, but something seems a bit off. Maybe it’s the fact that their mouth doesn’t seem to be moving perfectly in sync with their words or maybe it’s that Hanks is trying to sell some sketchy-looking medication you’ve never heard of.

Well, you’re right to be skeptical. Thanks to artificial intelligence technology, celebrities are being used left and right in AI deepfake videos and images for all kinds of scams, hawking products they’ve never actually endorsed. And cybersecurity company McAfee has a new list rounding up the most commonly used celebrity likenesses of the past year.

## Covid-19 Situation

Scarlett Johnasson tops the list, which is particularly interesting given her advocacy against non-consensual AI content. Johnasson said she was approached by OpenAI to provide a voice for their robotic assistant tech, but the actress declined. OpenAI went ahead and made a sound-alike voice for one of the company’s demos but seems to have scrapped the voice after Johansson threatened a lawsuit.

The list from McAfee, with the company’s explanations:

- Scarlett Johansson: Actress and Singer whose name and likeness has been used without permission for advertisements and endorsements, outspoken advocate against non-consensual AI-generated content
- Kylie Jenner: Reality star and influencer whose name and likeness has been used without permission for social media giveaway scams and fake Kylie Cosmetics products and websites
- Taylor Swift: Singer whose name and likeness has been used without permission for celebrity endorsement, ticket scams, and product giveaway scams, as well as for disinformation (political endorsement)
- Anya Taylor-Joy: Actress whose name, and social account/likeness has been used without permission for a giveaway scam, and to spread misinformation about her streaming series
- Tom Hanks: Actor whose name and likeness has been used without permission to promote “miracle cures and wonder drugs”
- Sabrina Carpenter: Singer whose name and likeness has been used without permission for fake ticketing scams and to advertise an app for creating sexually explicit images
- Sydney Sweeney: Actress whose name and likeness has been used without permission for crypto scams
- Blake Lively: Actress whose likeness was used without permission in a weight loss gummy scam
- Johnny Depp: Actor whose likeness has been used without permission in giveaway, crypto, and fundraising scams
- Addison Rae: Singer and actress whose likeness has been used without permission for fake endorsements, giveaways, and crypto scams

“In a time when celebrity news is part of everyday conversation and accessible with the click of a button, people often prioritize convenience over online safety, clicking on suspicious links promising celebrity content or related goods,” Abhishek Karnik, McAfee’s Head of Threat Research, said in a statement published online.
