In August 2024, we asked our customers to tell us about security: their role in security, their certifications, their concerns, and what their companies are doing to address those concerns. We had 1,322 complete responses, of which 419 (32%—roughly one-third) are members of a security team. 903 respondents aren’t on a security team, although 19% of that group hold at least one security-related certification. This report focuses primarily on the security team members, though we’ll look from time to time at the others; they also have valuable information about what their companies are doing.

Our goal was to understand the state of security: What challenges do security teams face? What projects are they building to defend their companies against cybercrime? And what kinds of expertise do they have or want to acquire?

Here’s a brief summary of our findings:

- Phishing, network intrusion, and ransomware are the top security threats.
- Most companies have implemented multifactor authentication, endpoint security, and zero trust.
- Roughly half of all respondents work for companies that require security staff to hold one or more security certifications.
- The most commonly required certifications are the CISSP and CompTIA Security+. These are also the most widely held and most desired certifications.
- Cloud security and AI vulnerabilities are the biggest skills gaps.
- Security professionals need to stay up-to-date by engaging in ongoing training, using online courses, books, and videos.
  With any survey, it’s important to be aware of the biases. Are our customers typical of the security industry? Possibly; our customers include individuals and a wide range of corporate clients representing many different industries. Are the users who fill out surveys typical of the security community? Probably not, especially since the security community tends to be very private. Nevertheless, the only way to find out what people are doing is to ask.

## Who We Talked To

Of the respondents who are directly involved in security, 16.2% are managers, 7.2% are CISOs, and 1.2% are information systems security managers (a role defined by NIST). That adds up to 24.6%, roughly a quarter of the total number of respondents on security teams.

15.3% said their role was “security architect,” and 12.6% described their role as “security engineer.” That gives us 27.9% whose role involves designing security systems—again, roughly a quarter of the total. It almost certainly overstates the percentage of security architects.

Security specialists—both cybersecurity specialists (10.3%) and security specialists (8.6%)—are another distinct group. These are the people responsible for the “blocking and tackling”: the work of protecting systems and data. Together, they represent 18.9% of the total.

## It’s About Training

Security is no longer taken for granted; that’s a significant change we’ve seen over the last decade. Our respondents—both those who work in security and those who don’t—are aware of the threats and the risks. They believe in the importance of certification, even when it isn’t required. They’re aware of the need for training. They’re working on acquiring additional certifications and taking the training that’s needed to earn them. Certifications like the CISSP, which is both wide-ranging and in-depth, are most desirable. But there are areas with skills shortages, such as the cloud. We’ll probably see a rush for training on AI security when those resources are available. And the people who will take those courses don’t just need any old training: They need high-quality, high-value training that delivers real knowledge, not just the ability to answer questions on an exam.

Most of all, our respondents believe that security is everyone’s responsibility. What will it take to make phishing—the number one threat—the exception rather than the rule? What will it take to make ransomware a rare event? Most companies train employees in the basics, but it needs to be every company
