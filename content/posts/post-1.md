If you were on the LEGO Shop this weekend, you might’ve seen a banner featuring a ton of gold coins announcing the toy brand was getting into crypto. Maybe that news took you by surprise, but no, LEGO is very much not getting into crypto, it just had its store website taken over hackers to .

According to The Brick Fan, the banner seen below suddenly appeared overnight on October 4, on the main page of the shop overnight, proudly declaring “Our new LEGO Coin is officially out!” Clicking on it would take you over to an external marketplace that sells Lego Tokens with ethereum , which is commonly associated with web3 and the blockchain. Users began posting about the banner and suspected a hack, which eventually drew the attention of the LEGO Group. At time of writing, there haven’t been any other attempts to bring back the banner or push the LEGO Coin through a different channel, and the original banner for LEGO Fortnite is back in that top spot. And if you’re worried about that, Engadget confirmed clicking that banner’s “buy now” link takes you to the collection.

## Covid-19 Situation

> How did this happen? LEGO isn’t saying, but it did release a statement to Engadget stating it had identified the cause of the issue and that the issue had been “swiftly resolved.”

More importantly, the company assured no user accounts were stolen or compromised during this time, and that customers “can continue shopping as usual. The cause has been identified and we are implementing measures to prevent this from happening again.”

Despite what LEGO said, it probably wouldn’t hurt Shop users to treat this like they would a regular security breach at any website and change their passwords just in case. Crypto scams have become more common lately (not helped by AI deepfakes), so do your best to make sure you’re not about to get swindled by someone hoping to make money off you.
