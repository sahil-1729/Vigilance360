In the long history of computer crime, the players, goals and tactics have seen a lot of change.

Early computers were fairly isolated systems reserved for niche applications, mainly in academic environments. The first instances of security "attacks" were examples of tinkering that went too far rather than malicious activity.

Todayâ€™s world is different. Computers power many aspects of our day-to-day lives. They are faster than ever and highly inter-connected. They are in our pockets, homes and offices, but also in our toothbrushes and refrigerators. They even power our critical infrastructure. This now widespread reliance on computers (and the data they process) attracts new kinds of malfeasants.

## The simple effectiveness of ransomware

Ransomware is an extremely lucrative example of computer crime going "corporate": incentivized by the will of making more money by investing less effort.

Most ransomware attacks follow a simple pattern:

1. They start by running a malicious tool, an encryptor, on the target system. True to its name, the encryptor will then encrypt the whole disk (or disks) and delete the key. If the perpetrators intend to make the data recoverable, they will keep a copy of the key on their files, away from the affected system.

2. Then, they make their presence known, from red screens to timers. Ransomware campaigns go great lengths to communicate with their victims because they get their money only if the victims believe that paying is the best chance they have to recover their data.

3. After payment, an "honorable" ransomware gang will provide the victim a decryptor tool with the secret key.

There are some instances of ransomware that do not encrypt the data. Instead, the attackers threaten the victims by disclosing data publicly, which could cause embarrassment or leak industrial secrets.

Ransomware's rise: from low-tech scams to organized crime

Challenging attackers
However, with ransomware attacks, there are two steps that are somewhat challenging for the attackers:

**Challenge** #1: Getting the encryptor into the target system. Unfortunately, attackers can (still) benefit from a very simple tactic: asking nicely. Phishing attacks are popular ways of distributing ransomware encryptors because many victims eagerly click links on emails without verifying the origin or giving it a thought. Technical entry points traditionally used to deliver malware remain a useful alternative: if there is an open file share, the attacker can deploy the file into the target system, then find another vulnerability to execute it. WannaCry, the attack considered by many as the most damaging ransomware campaign to date, is an example of this.

**Challenge** #2: Receiving the ransom payment without betraying the attacker's identity. Fifteen years ago, this challenge alone would have hindered the expansion of ransomware gangs. They would need to pay in cash, which is hard to scale and would be geographically restricted to the area of influence of the gang, or they would need to rely on digital payments and withdraw the money fast, creating a trail of evidence leading directly to the gang. However, the rise of cryptocurrency presented a solution to this challenge.

While authorities have succeeded in tracking down malicious businesses who took ransom in cryptocurrencies, the international availability of a means of payment that is not linked to an actual identity has made it much easier for criminals to receive their payments and much harder for law enforcement to follow the tracks.

## Wrapping up

At a technical level, ransomware is not a terribly novel threat. The disruptive aspect of it lies in the economic incentives it introduces, leading to more organized criminal structures with the freedom to act more ruthlessly and at a larger scale, and to attack sensitive industries with the hope of maximizing their payment. It is a threat worth considering because it is increasingly prevalent and, for companies caught unprepared, could wreak havoc on their infrastructure. Just remember: do not pay the ransom.
