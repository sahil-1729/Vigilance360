This month, the U.S. Senate’s Special Committee On Aging held a hearing to address elder financial fraud. It is entitled Fighting Fraud: How Scammers are Stealing from Older Adults.

Ranking member Senator Braun stated that Medicare fraud alone cost taxpayers $60B in 2023. The committee thoroughly explored the broad topic of financial elder abuse and solutions.

Here at AgingParents.com, where we see the vulnerability of elders firsthand, and repeatedly hear about clients’ aging parents being ripped off, we are glad to see the Senate paying attention. There was testimony from various qualified witnesses at the hearing, which is recorded. Among them was Kathy Stokes, Director of Fraud Prevention Programs AARP Fraud Watch Network.

## How Criminals Are Using AI to Be More Effective

It used to be that you could tell if an email supposedly from your bank or financial institution was phony because of misspelled words. Or if you got a phone call purporting to be from a family member, but their voice sounded different, you would be suspicious. But now, AI is already being leveraged by fraud criminals to turn grammatically incorrect emails and texts into perfectly formed and convincing messages. It’s being used to create realistic fake photos, videos and websites that are designed to make the target believe they’re real.

How We Can Fight Fraud

From the testimony at the hearing, suggestions were put forth. We all can do the following, regardless of our age. Scammers are after everyone, not just elders.

1. Freeze credit with the credit reporting agencies. You an unfreeze it if you need to at any time.

2. Use a password manager and multifactor authentication for your online accounts.

3. Shred your financial documents, bills and other identifying correspondence.

4. Keep your device’s operating systems udated to protect against known vulnerabilities. Outdated systems on your computer or phone are more readily hackable.

5. Never engage with incoming messages from unknown persons.

6. Talk about the latest info on scams and sneaky methods these criminals use. Help aging parents understand how anyone can be approached in many ways by fraudsters.

The more we talk about these scams, the better protected we will be. Families need to help their vulnerable elders understand how vigilant they must be to stay safe.
