Hate crimes recorded in Scotland have increased by 63% since controversial new legislation came into force in April.

Police Scotland said more than 5,400 hate crimes had been recorded in the past six months, most of which have been related to race and age.

The increase followed the introduction of the Hate Crime and Public Order Act, which created a new offence outlawing threatening or abusive behaviour intended to stir up hatred.

## Convictions so far

Alan Speirs, deputy chief constable with Police Scotland, said the legislation had seen a "significant difference in confidence" from people reporting hate crimes now.

He added that the "most significant" number of cases related to either race or religion, and were most common in Dundee, Edinburgh or Glasgow.

A spokesman for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) said "careful consideration" was given towards any case.

He added: "In the very short time since the legislation came into force, 468 charges have been reported to us with some form of prosecutorial action taken in relation to almost 94% of the charges reported. Forty two charges have resulted in a conviction with a further 82% of charges ongoing in court.

“As one would expect in such a short time many of the charges reported are still ongoing in court and it would not be prudent to make any assumptions regarding the efficacy of legislation at such an early stage.”

The legislation was introduced in April with the intention of extending protection for those considered most at risk of hate crimes, based on disability, race, religion, sexual orientation and transgender identity.

The bill streamlined the law by bringing together existing hate crime laws into a single piece of legislation while creating a new crime of "stirring up hatred" against protected groups.

The Hate Crime and Public Order Act was introduced in April

Police Scotland said the wave of early numbers had subsided since then.

A total of 679 hate crimes were directed towards on-duty police officers and staff.

About 10% of the hate crimes proved to be non-crime hate incidents (NCHIs).

Brown told BBC Scotland News: "Hatred and prejudice has a damaging and corrosive impact on victims and wider communities.
"It is vital that everyone in Scotland feels safe, and this data shows hate crime laws are being used to hold to account those who target vulnerable communities and commit criminal acts fuelled by hatred and prejudice."
