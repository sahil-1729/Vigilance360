- Google is spearheading a new effort against online fraud by teaming up with the Global Anti-Scam Alliance and the DNS Research Federation to launch the Global Signal Exchange.
- This new platform aims to revolutionize how scam research is tracked and shared worldwide, leveraging the strengths of its partners.
- The GSE is already operational with a pilot program, where Google has shared over 100,000 URLs related to malicious merchants and collected around 1 million scam signals.

Google is leading a new alliance to fight online fraud, partnering with two anti-scam groups to launch a global hub for sharing research on cybercrimes.

On Wednesday, Google unveiled the Global Signal Exchange (GSE), a new online platform that could shake up how fraud is tracked and reported. Built in partnership with the Global Anti-Scam Alliance (GASA) and the DNS Research Federation (DNS RF), the new hub aims to improve how scam research is handled worldwide.

The GSE brings together the expertise of three major players. GASA offers a huge network of stakeholders, while the DNS Research Federation brings a solid data platform with over 40 million signals. And, of course, Google adds its strong track record in fighting scams and fraud to this alliance.

The exchange is already up and running with a pilot program thatâ€™s already showing promise. So far, Google has played a major role by sharing over 100,000 URLs linked to malicious merchants and taking in about 1 million scam signals.

While the initial focus has been on flagged Google Shopping URLs, there are plans to bring in data from other Google products as the testing rolls on.

GSE is powered by the Google Cloud Platform, giving participants a solid base to share and tap into signals from one another. Plus, users get to take advantage of Google Cloud's smart AI tools to spot trends and match signals more effectively.
